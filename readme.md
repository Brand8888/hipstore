Angular Classifieds

What?
Made a simple classified application for 'Hipsters' using Angular and some of its module hooked up to Firebase.

Angular modules:
1. Angular-animate ~ Applied some animation to the classified card when users search/filter an item.
2. Angular-Material ~ Testing Angular-material - The aim was to make the web application behave like a native app.
3. Angular-ui-Router ~ Followed some online tutorial on nested routing for Angular - This can be seen at the page URL when users add or edit item & some simple page redirecting using $urlRouterProvider.
4. Firebase ~ Introduction to hooking up a SPA to Firebase for added interactivity for public users.


P/S Application is currently not mobile friendly ~ to be updated in future version.
